                  Do you believe that software can help communities and build a better world, but find it challenging to get started? I don’t wait for the right software to come along, I go and help build it together. 
                  In the little town of Veberöd Sweden, new technology to build a better community is continuing to go live. 
                  The student research team at Boston University combined with Software Engineering at the Red Hat Collaboratory has achieved very visible success in Research and Development together.

                  The project was one of the recipients of the inaugural Red Hat Collaboratory Research Incubation Awards, awarded to projects that take advantage of the collaboration between Boston University and Red Hat Research. 
                  The Red Hat Global Social Innovation Program is partnering with Boston University and Smarta Byar in order to create a global and open research platform. 
                  This will allow researchers to study what social sustainability means by using a digital twin of Veberöd, Sweden as the test village, supported by  Smarta Byar. 
                  The goal of this collaboration is to build the open source technological infrastructure so that researchers can collaborate on this platform effectively to study mobility, public health, sustainability among other study areas to ultimately help define better the link between well being and eco-smart cities.

                  Since our collaboration started back in March 2022, the students of Boston University came up with simulations of a traffic stop in our test village of Veberöd. 
                  Myself from Red Hat built a scalable online platform to import the student’s simulations, and report the data in maps and dashboards. 
                  Jan from Smarta Byar helped us integrate with IOT Nodes from the village. The online platform allowed us to share our results and accomplish the goals for the project:

                  The Smarta Byar organization has been busy deploying new smart sensors in Veberöd. 
                  We have added new integration with FIWARE technology implementing their Smart Data Models to align ourselves with the rest of the open source smart solution community. 
                  The active research, development, deployment, and standards in this partnership has really moved the project forward since we started less than 1 year ago.

                  Boston University students have done an incredible job simulating traffic at the first potential intersection requiring a traffic light in Veberöd. 
                  They use an open source application called 
              - e: a

                text: |
                  to pick a place on a map and load in all the road data into a directory of files for simulation. 
                  The road data did not have all the details they needed to simulate pedestrian traffic, so they used the SUMO tools to add those sidewalks. 
                  The default traffic light algorithm proved to be inefficient, so they put their advanced science background to work to develop a new traffic pattern that optimized the traffic flow in all directions for both vehicles and people traffic. 
                  The new simulation works very efficiently as you can see in the simulation above, where the cars are orange dots, the pedestrians are purple dots, and the traffic light turns from green to red over time.

                      Earlier in 2022, the Red Hat Social Innovation Program brought the talented Red Hat Open Innovation Labs together with FIWARE for a 6 week residency and deployed a comprehensive FIWARE ecosystem on OpenShift for the first time.

                      Since that residency, I had the pleasure of meeting participants from the Open Innovation Labs team, as well as the collaborators from the FIWARE and HOPU teams at the FIWARE Summit in Gran Canaria, Spain. 
                      I heard their story and was thrilled to hear about the GitOps they have shared with the open source community to deploy the context broker on OpenShift. 
                      After coming home from the conference, I couldn’t wait to try it out on my own

                      Building on the great work already done during the residency, I was able to take even more GitOps capabilities I have learned working on the Red Hat Research Engineering Team and contribute it to the FIWARE community.

                      There are models available in a dozen current domains including smart cities, agrifood, water, energy, environment, sensoring, aeronautics, destination, robotics, health, manufacturing, and cross sector. 
                      If you are building smart solutions as well, you are likely to find that your data matches one of the colossal 795 defined data models combined in all of these domains! The FIWARE Context Broker supports all of these data models, which is why our project is now powered by a FIWARE Context Broker.
